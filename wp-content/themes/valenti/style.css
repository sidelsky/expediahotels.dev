/* The stylesheet is located in "library/css/style.css", however, it is strongly recommended that you never edit a theme's stylesheet directly. Put your custom code in the "Custom CSS" box in the theme's options or use the Child Theme and edit that. That way you won't lose any changes in future theme updates. Another good way is to use the Custom CSS plugin that comes with Wordpress Jetpack. Good luck! */
